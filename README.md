# MyPortfolio-using-JavaScript

During learning basic of JavaScript, I had the opportunity to develop this project which is a portfolio website to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects. I dedicated my efforts to creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface that effectively represented my personal brand. 
 
The website featured a clean and modern design, incorporating responsive layouts to ensure optimal viewing on various devices.

This portfolio website not only highlights my technical abilities but also reflects my passion, creativity, and attention to detail.
